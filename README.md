## How to Play 🕹️

1. The game will prompt Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) to enter their respective moves in turns.
2. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid with numbers from 1 to 9. Players should enter the number corresponding to the space where they want to place their symbol. For example, to place an 'X' in the top-left corner, Player 1 should enter `1`.

```
Player 'X', which space would you like to mark?: 1
X | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

3. After each move, the game will update the board and display it for the next player to make their choice.

4. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game will automatically detect the end of the game and display the result.
